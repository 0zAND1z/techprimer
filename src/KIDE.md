To facilitate a seamless environment for the developers and achieve shorter GTM time, KIP offers distinctive features enabling developers at various stages of development ranging from Design to using KIDE for devlopment & Krama Services etc. for reliable production; thereby reducing the significant cost associated with time to launch & maintaining the silo services.  

### KIDE - Krama Integrated Development Environment

KIDE is a next-gen IDE targeted for collaborative minds in the blockchain. KIDE is a hybrid form of IDE with special abilities to integrate blockchain-based critical business components into existing infrastructures & solution mediums.

KIDE also offers the developers an oversight in targeting a larger pool of audience & effectively utilizing the transactional data created by the users in the business environment. This is made possible by pipelining a few components in a seamless manner:

- **Editor:** A browser-based collaborative editor to churn smart contracts in a JS-like or Python-like style. Inspired by Remix IDE, KIDE's editor shall support themes, custom syntax highlighting & a load of other features to comfort the developer.
- **Debugger:** KIDE will support a debugger with robust options for breakpoints, trace calls, stacktrace, among few.
- **ATL State Analyzer:** KIDE exhibits a new feature of simulating the behavior of the diApps / Smart Contracts with an Automata language-generic State Analyzer injected inline to the debug & build modes.
- **Leypa Injector:** KIDE is inspired by web3's vision to integrate & unify the decentralized applications for a seamless user experience. Leypa is injected into KIDE for testing & debugging the diApps in the KIP's `main-net` or `test-net` realms.  

Leypa is also injected into mobile & web applications referring to a diApp / smart contract deployed in one of the KIP realms as stated above.
