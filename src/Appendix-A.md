## Appendix A: Terminology

1. **Blockchain Realm:** A super set of networks running heterogenous blockchain protocols.
2. **Storage Realm:** A super set of networks running heterogenous decentralized file storage protocols.
3. **Infrastructure Realm:** A global network of computational hardware eligible for formally verifying the transactions & achieve network consensus.
4. **Solutions Realm:** A sub set of the network with live applications & re-usable templates to augment business logic & processes.
5. **Digital Fabric:** An evolutionary protocol that binds multiple protocols together for a business goal addressed across multiple verticals of its application.
6. **Protobuf:** A library of methods used to serialize structured data; used by the programs to communicate with each other for persisting data in a network medium.
7. **Trust Quotient:** A score attributed to an account of specific type, derived based on the activities and the result of actions.
8. **State Channel:** A state channel in KIP is constituted by a network of nodes forming a consortium in a dynamic manner, agreeing to formally verify the transactions belonging to a certain set of asset classes.
9. **Single floor communication:** KIP's PoV of a 'single floor communication' is to expect formal verification of transactions by every node participating in the network, without the need for eligibility to participate in consensus & associated activities.
10. **Kademlia bucket lookups:** A method of evaluating the distance between the nodes by applying the XOR function to the Node ID(s) or their keys.
11. **Shadow broadcasting:** A novel method of selective hearing introduced in the TARA Framework to achieve preferential consensus among the sub-set of the nodes in the network.
12. **Shadow broadcasting:** A novel method of selective hearing introduced in the TARA Framework to achieve preferential consensus among the sub-set of the nodes in the network.
13. **Swarm key:** An experimental feature which facilitates the creation of private IPFS network by generating a key in an IPFS node, sharable across the network.
