## Conclusion

We propose an efficient system & underlying methods that establish distributed intelligence with big data persistence, scalability, maximized throughput & predictable TCO by various approaches to orchestrate, partition, arrange and pass messages in a deterministic manner, thereby encouraging businesses to adopt a minimalistic approach to obtain exponential scaling on various range of computational devices; accompanied by capturing values, and attribute them to respective transactions propagated by actors in the network.
